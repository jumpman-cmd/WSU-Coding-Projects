# CircleApp

## Description
This repository contains a Java program that models a circle and provides methods to compute its area, circumference, and diameter. The program consists of a `Circle` class that encapsulates the properties and behaviors of a circle, and a `CircleApp` class that demonstrates the usage of the `Circle` class.

## About This Program
The `Circle` class includes:
- Constructors to initialize a circle with different sets of parameters.
- Methods to calculate the area, circumference, and diameter of the circle.
- Mutator methods to set the circle's radius and coordinates.
- Accessor methods to get the circle's radius and coordinates.

The `CircleApp` class includes a `main` method that:
1. Creates three `Circle` objects with different initializations.
2. Displays the properties and computed values of each circle.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the `CircleApp` class to see the output.

### Sample Output
Circle object 1:
Radius: 1.0
X and Y Coordinates: 0, 0
Area: 3.1415927
Circumference: 6.2831855

Circle object 2:
Radius: 8.0
X and Y Coordinates: 0, 0
Area: 201.06194
Circumference: 50.265484
Diameter: 16.0

Circle object 3:
Radius: 28.0
X and Y Coordinates: 21, 10
Area: 2463.008
Circumference: 175.92918
Diameter: 56.0
