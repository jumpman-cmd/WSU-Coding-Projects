# WSU-Coding-Projects

## Description
This repository contains a collection of coding tasks and projects from my coursework at Walter Sisulu University. Unfortunately, my hard drive crashed, and I lost most of my projects. I will be adding the ones I can find.

## About This Repository
During my time at Walter Sisulu University, I worked on numerous coding assignments and projects. However, due to a hard drive failure, I have lost many of these files. I did not regularly use GitHub to back up my work, which has resulted in this loss. Moving forward, I will ensure to back up my work on GitHub to prevent such issues.

In this repository, you will find:
- Coding tasks I was able to recover
- Descriptions and documentation for each project

## Contents
The repository will include projects in various programming languages and on different topics that were part of my coursework. Below are some of the types of projects you can expect to find:
- Java Projects
- C++ Projects
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Web Development Projects (HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript)
- Database Management Systems
- And a few AI programs

## Adding New Projects
As I find more of my old projects, I will add them to this repository. Each project will include:
- A description (README) of the task or project
- The code files
- Instructions on how to run or use the project

## How to Use This Repository
You can browse through the repository to see the different projects. Each project will be in its own folder with a README file explaining the details of the project.

### Conclusion
This repository serves as a portfolio of my coding journey at Walter Sisulu University. It highlights the various programming languages and technologies I have learned and applied in my coursework. By uploading these projects to GitHub, I aim to showcase my skills to potential employers and collaborators. Additionally, it will help me stay organized and ensure that my work is securely backed up and easily accessible.

I understand the importance of version control and regular backups now more than ever. This experience has taught me the value of platforms like GitHub in maintaining and sharing my work. Moving forward, I will use GitHub as my primary tool for managing my coding projects and assignments.

Thank you for visiting my repository. I hope you find my work informative and useful.
